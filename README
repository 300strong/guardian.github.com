Releasing:

In order to release a project into this repository ensure the following.  Look at this to see https://github.com/guardian/guardian-management/blob/master/pom.xml how the scm and distributionManagement elements are configured:

1) your project is up to date and checked into it's repository
2) run mvn release:prepare - this will update release numbers and push those into your repository
3) run mvn release:perform - this copies the artifacts to the directory
4) add, commit and push this repository
