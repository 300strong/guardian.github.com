In the spirit of open journalism we are open about what we are working on, the problems we are encountering and the way we are solving them. We write about our techniques, tools and in the interests of sharing with the development community but also to get feedback from all the smart developers who outside the Guardian. We also want to recognise how much our success is based on the open software community of code, advice and opinion.
