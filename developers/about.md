[The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com) is a unique news organisation whose journalism can be found across a range of different platforms. As we are owned by the [Scott Trust](http://www.gmgplc.co.uk/the-scott-trust/) we exist to serve our high standards of journalism and uphold our liberal values. We can truly hold the powerful to account as we have demonstrated with our reporting on [phone hacking](http://www.theguardian.com/media/phone-hacking), [police spying](http://www.theguardian.com/world/surveillance+uk/police), [slavery in Qatar](http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/series/modern-day-slavery-in-focus+world/qatar) and of course in our work on exposing [NSA spying](http://www.theguardian.com/world/nsa).

With a highly distinctive, open approach to publishing on the web, part of Guardian News &amp; Media’s digital-first strategy, we now have a global audience of tens of millions and editorial offices on three continents.

It’s our aspiration to make the Guardian the number one quality news site in the world. Not just by a bit, but by a long way. We’re doing this by merging the innovation and energy of a start-up with our ground-breaking journalism, all backed by the Guardian respected brand.

Guardian developers build the products that showcase our diverse and important journalism. We create tools that allow journalists and editors to write their stories securely, anywhere from London to Syria, and build APIs and services that allow those stories to be distributed across the globe. Everything we do is in pursuit of the values in which the Guardian was founded.
