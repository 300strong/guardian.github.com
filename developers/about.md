[The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com) is a unique news organisation whose journalism can be found across a range of different platforms. As we are owned by the [Scott Trust](http://www.gmgplc.co.uk/the-scott-trust/) we exist to serve our high standards of journalism and uphold our liberal values. We can truly hold the powerful to account as we have demonstrated with our reporting on [phone hacking](http://www.theguardian.com/media/phone-hacking), [police spying](http://www.theguardian.com/world/surveillance+uk/police), [slavery in Qatar](http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/series/modern-day-slavery-in-focus+world/qatar) and of course in our work on exposing [NSA spying](http://www.theguardian.com/world/nsa).

With a highly distinctive, open approach to publishing on the web, part of Guardian News &amp; Media’s digital-first strategy, we now have a global audience of tens of millions and editorial offices on three continents.

It’s our aspiration to make the Guardian the number one quality news site in the world. Not just by a bit, but by a long way. We’re doing this by merging the innovation and energy of a start-up with our ground-breaking journalism, all backed by the Guardian respected brand.

Guardian developers build the products that showcase our diverse and important journalism.

Everything we do is in pursuit of the values in which the Guardian was founded.

### Jim Murphy, Head of QA

The QA team's primary responsibility is to test The Guardian's digital products prior to their release to ensure that they are of a high quality, and are accessible on all supported browsers and devices used by our audience.

QAs work as part of cross-functional product teams, alongside developers, scrum masters, product managers, designers and usability engineers, to deliver new product features and enhancements within two week Sprints.

The team's philosophy is to be as adaptive and agile as possible when testing so that we can create the best products possible in the best time frame possible. Recently the team have implemented several major changes to our testing processes across our products to ensure that we can release new product features more frequently and with a higher degree of quality. This includes the implementation of an automated testing approach, that ensures our testing is accurate, cost-effective and and most importantly fast at detecting issues prior to a Product's release.
