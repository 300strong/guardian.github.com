Akka is a toolkit and runtime for building highly concurrent, distributed and fault tolerant event-driven applications, but it can also be very useful for those of us who more commonly build applications that run happily on a single EC2 micro.
In this talk I aim to convince you that, even if you're not building a distributed system processing millions of transactions per second, Akka is a toolkit which can help build correct, elegant solutions. I'll demonstrate patterns from production apps at the Guardian to illustrate this.
