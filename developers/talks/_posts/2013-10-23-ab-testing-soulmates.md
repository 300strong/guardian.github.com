* How did we get started with A/B testing for Soulmates?
  
  * Not everything was clear up front
  * Reviewed some data and just started some tests
  * Learnt as we went along

* Case study of one "theme" of tests
* What did we learn?
  
  * Important to have a hypothesis agreed upfront
  * Be really clear about the ONE goal so that there is no debate later
  * Don't despair if tests are not successful. They give as much insight as successful tests
