We employ software developers, data analysts and software engineers in test.

## Software developer

We’re in the content delivery business. We have a reputation for powerful investigative journalism, a global audience and a passion for community collaboration. We’re reinventing our digital products and we need great engineers to help us.

### Us

Development of digital products is central to the future of the Guardian. We build the products that showcase our diverse and important journalism. We create the tools that the journalists and editors use to write their stories securely, anywhere from London to Syria. We write the APIs and services that allow those stories to be distributed across the globe. We write the products and interfaces that show off and monetise that content to its maximum potential.

We mostly program in Scala and Javascript, but we use the best tool that fits the problem. We have hacks in the wild in all manner of languages. Our infrastructure lives on AWS and our own OpenStack private cloud. We encourage product teams to implement, manage and support their own stack. We do our coding in public. Sadly, the same can be said of our karaoke.

### You

You’re a passionate, intelligent human being who loves technology. You might love the news, or you might want to reinvent it.

You like inspiring the people you work with and being inspired by them in return. You have experience of getting stuff done.
You are a talented Engineer who is, or will be, an expert in their chosen field and has a strong interest in all software engineering disciplines.
