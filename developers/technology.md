Our director of architecture, Graham Tackley, recently gave at GOTO about how he sees the current state of development and how he thinks developers should organise and approach developing software.

Teams within the Digital Department have a lot of autonomy to make the right choices about what technology they use to deliver their work. What works for delivering the iOS News Edition app is going to be quite different from how we implement the CMS tools journalists use.

That means there is a wide variety of technologies and application stacks in use within the department. Developers are expected to work on multiple projects so we are kind polyglot developers by default.

## The core technologies

* Scala
* Javascript
* HTML and CSS
* Objective C
* Java (Android)

## The Whitelist

There are certain combinations of technologies that are used so frequently in the department they are regarded as de facto standards. If you use whitelisted solutions then you don't need to check your decisions with Architecture or Operations, we aim to make it easy to develop and deploy whitelist solutions to production.

* Scala
* Javascript
* AWS
